Sinister-Blade
As a fan of Assassins Creed games saga I'm more than mad that there is no such game for android. But on the other hand there are not just one but few of them for iPhone. I'm not gonna build an Assassins Creed game, but I took the idea from this very big problem. People want to play such and similar games on android mobile phones. Currently there are none existing alike games. The game itself would be done in 2D (maybe 3D – if I can manage to do it in time). Currently I'm thinking about the name of the game protagonist. The game itself will follow him in present time in which he is charged as guilty for something he did. Then the story line will be moved for some certain time in past. Then through the story bring to light everything regarding the protagonists life and actions for which he is accused. Title would be „Sinister blade“. It will include various actions. From jumping, climbing, killing and etc. Also there would be some kind of hidden treasures that can you give extra armor or new clothes. For now I'm not planning to make more levels, just one. For future work, if this game made a breakthrough, add more levels and expand the very story.
